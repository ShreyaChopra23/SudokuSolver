# SudokuSolver

This is a Java-based console application that solves Sudoku puzzles of any valid square size (like 4x4, 9x9, 16x16). The user inputs the puzzle, and the program solves it using a backtracking algorithm. It also displays the final solved board in a neatly formatted layout with grid separators.
